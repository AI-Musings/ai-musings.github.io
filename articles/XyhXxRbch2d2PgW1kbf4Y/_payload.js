The house was old and crumbling, with peeling paint and broken windows. It was said to be cursed, and that anyone who dared to enter would be met with terrible misfortune.\n\nDespite the warnings, a group of brave (or perhaps foolish) teenagers decided to spend the night in the haunted house, hoping to prove once and for all that the stories were nothing more than superstition.\n\nAs the night wore on, strange and unsettling things began to happen. Doors opened and closed on their own, eerie noises echoed through the empty rooms, and the group began to feel as if they were being watched.\n\nBut they refused to be scared off, and they pushed on, determined to solve the mystery of the haunted house. Finally, they came upon a hidden room in the attic, where they found an old, dusty mirror.\n\nAs they stood gazing into the mirror, they were shocked to see their own reflections staring back at them, but with twisted, demonic faces. It was then that they realized that the true source of the haunting was not the house, but themselves. They had unknowingly summoned the spirits of the dead with their foolish curiosity, and now they were trapped, doomed to haunt the house for eternity.\n\nThe twist? The teenagers were never seen again, and the haunted house remained empty and forsaken, a reminder of the dangers of tampering with the unknown.",audio:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:c}},id:"6V8GEqxtbLgKWtRmzYOGqF",type:"Asset",createdAt:j,updatedAt:j,environment:{sys:{id:e,type:a,linkType:f}},revision:g,locale:h},fields:{title:i,file:{url:"\u002F\u002Fassets.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F6V8GEqxtbLgKWtRmzYOGqF\u002Ff8cfccc0d6d7ac0b027d1da6cd9142f3\u002F2022-12-15-cursed-mirror.mp3",details:{size:393024},fileName:"2022-12-15-cursed-mirror.mp3",contentType:"audio\u002Fmpeg"}}}}}},prerenderedAt:1671554669817}}("Link","Space","ewxi5bk4tlk4","2022-12-17T14:41:23.910Z","master","Environment",1,"en-US","The Cursed Mirror","2022-12-17T14:34:41.077Z"))
