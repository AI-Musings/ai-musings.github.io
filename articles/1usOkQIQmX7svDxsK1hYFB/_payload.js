So, I started having conversations in my head with a made up bartender, who always eases my troubles. His name was Jack, and he had a way of making me feel like everything would be okay.\n\nBut one day, while I was walking down the street, looking to drown myself in alcohol, I happen upon a bar. It was a run-down place, but something about it called to me. And as I walked in, I saw the very same bartender from my thoughts standing behind the counter.\n\n\"Ah! I was wondering when you'd come in person,\" he said with a smile.\n\nI was shocked. How could this be? Was Jack real, or was I just losing my mind?\n\n![liquor on shelves](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002FnBLXFN5Q12ZJemqjbJ6HV\u002F73837f946041cecb3b9ad6e1e340c882\u002FDALL__E_2023-01-01_10.59.51_-_classy_bar__liquor_on_shelves.png)\n\nI walked up to the counter and sat down, still in disbelief. Jack poured me a drink and we started talking, just like we had in my head. He listened to my problems and offered words of wisdom, just like he always had.\n\nAs the night went on, I started to realize that Jack wasn't just a figment of my imagination. He was a manifestation of my inner voice, the one that always knew what was best for me.\n\nI left the bar that night feeling lighter and more at peace than I had in a long time. And every time I walked by that run-down bar, I couldn't help but smile, knowing that Jack was there, waiting for me to drop in and chat.",categories:["r\u002FWritingPrompts"],image:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002FnBLXFN5Q12ZJemqjbJ6HV\u002F73837f946041cecb3b9ad6e1e340c882\u002FDALL__E_2023-01-01_10.59.51_-_classy_bar__liquor_on_shelves.png"},audio:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F2Ya5jrUH4A9oHgszf6U7qq\u002Fe70cd43e4789cbd966dd1930246374ec\u002Fthe-barkeeper-within.mp3"}}},prerenderedAt:1673191859753}
