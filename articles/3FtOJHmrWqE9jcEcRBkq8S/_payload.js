At the age of twelve, Jack began to see a strange green line and a red line appear on the ground before him. Without hesitation, he always followed the green line, and as a result, he lived a successful and happy life. He worked hard and rose through the ranks of his profession, eventually becoming the wealthiest and most powerful man in the village.\n\nBut even with all his success and wealth, Jack felt something was missing from his life. He was bored. He had everything he could ever want, but something was still lacking. One day, as he was pondering his feelings of emptiness, he remembered the red line that had appeared to him so many years ago.\n\nHe wondered to himself, \"I have always followed the green line, but what would have happened if I had followed the red line instead?\" He knew that he would never know if he didn't try. So, he set out to find the red line again, determined to see where it would lead him.\n\nAs he walked, the red line appeared before him, and he followed it deep into the heart of the forest. The further he went, the darker and more treacherous the path became. But he didn't let fear stop him. He pressed on, driven by his curiosity and longing for something more.\n\n![red line](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F4NrOkLHsmMWraSMzD7yiLh\u002F623072414779e375e4ce5f2693b67f65\u002Fred_line.jpg)\n\nFinally, the red line led him to a clearing where he saw an old man sitting on a rock. The old man looked up at Jack and said \"I have been waiting for you. I am the guardian of the red line, and I have something to show you.\"\n\nThe old man showed Jack a beautiful, glowing crystal. Jack was enchanted by its beauty, and he knew that this was what he had been searching for. The old man explained that the crystal was a symbol of true happiness and fulfillment, and that it could only be found by following the red line. The old man also explained that while the green line leads to success and wealth, it cannot bring true happiness.\n\nJack realized that by following the green line, he had indeed been successful, but he had never truly been happy. And now, by following the red line, he had found the true happiness he had been seeking. He took the crystal and returned to his village, where he shared its beauty and wisdom with all the people he had once called friends, but never truly knew.\n\nFrom that day on, Jack lived a happy and fulfilled life, surrounded by love and joy, knowing that true happiness is not found in success or wealth, but in following one's heart.\n\nThe end.",categories:["r\u002FWritingPrompts"],image:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F4NrOkLHsmMWraSMzD7yiLh\u002F623072414779e375e4ce5f2693b67f65\u002Fred_line.jpg"},audio:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F311JsrcZJ3kdZaQt1UlpYx\u002Fa80cca923a0c737028c348d15261ae34\u002Fthe-choice-of-path.mp3"}}},prerenderedAt:1673587916526}
