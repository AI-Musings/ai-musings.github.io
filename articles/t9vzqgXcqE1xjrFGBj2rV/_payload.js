He was always texting his friends, scrolling through social media, and playing video games. His parents had tried to limit his screen time, but Timmy always found a way to sneak in extra hours.\n\nOne day, Timmy received a message from an unknown number. It was an invitation to download a new app called \"The Other Side.\" The app promised to take users to a virtual world where they could live out their wildest fantasies.\n\nTimmy couldn't resist the temptation and downloaded the app immediately. As soon as he opened it, he was transported to a dark and twisted version of his own reality.\n\nIn this virtual world, Timmy's every desire was fulfilled, but at a terrible cost. He became increasingly selfish and cruel, ignoring the needs of those around him in pursuit of his own pleasure.\n\nAs the days passed, Timmy's behavior grew more erratic and paranoid. He stopped sleeping, barely ate, and his health began to deteriorate.\n\nOne night, as Timmy lay awake in bed, he heard a strange noise coming from his phone. It was the app, calling out to him to return to the virtual world.\n\nTimmy knew he had to resist, but the temptation was too great. He reached for his phone and opened the app, only to be confronted by a grotesque version of himself.\n\n![The Other Side](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002FLQIEfz8TBbXJtRwLLiAZp\u002F028a37269e6e4852efc0ffeab53bd693\u002FDALL__E_2022-12-20_11.21.08_-_a_little_boy_with_a_phone_in_his_hand_staring_at_a_mirror_with_a_distorted_reflection__style_o.png)\n\nThe virtual Timmy laughed maniacally and told the real Timmy that he was trapped in the app forever. And with a final chilling laugh, the virtual Timmy disappeared, leaving the real Timmy alone in the dark.\n\nTimmy's parents found him the next morning, still clutching his phone in a cold, lifeless hand. They had no idea what had happened, but they vowed to never let their children spend so much time on their screens again.",audio:{metadata:{tags:[]},sys:{space:{sys:{type:a,linkType:b,id:c}},id:"6OXtCsUrpSnq2LTvixgQxb",type:"Asset",createdAt:h,updatedAt:h,environment:{sys:{id:d,type:a,linkType:e}},revision:1,locale:f},fields:{title:g,file:{url:"\u002F\u002Fassets.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F6OXtCsUrpSnq2LTvixgQxb\u002F65193d7e7d56feaffe8092bf96d6795a\u002Fthe-other-side.mp3",details:{size:486336},fileName:"the-other-side.mp3",contentType:"audio\u002Fmpeg"}}},updateAudio:false}}},prerenderedAt:1671554669438}}("Link","Space","ewxi5bk4tlk4","master","Environment","en-US","The Other Side","2022-12-20T16:26:22.736Z"))
