I was a raven, yes, but I was also so much more. I had a human friend who had taken me in and taught me to do all sorts of tricks. I could fetch sticks, bring back small trinkets, and even do a little dance on command.\n\nBut today was different. As I flew through the trees, my keen eyes scanning the ground below, I knew that today was going to be a good day. I had a feeling in my gut, a sense that something special was waiting for me.\n\nAnd then I saw it - a flash of color, caught in the corner of my eye. I flew closer, my heart beating with excitement. It was a piece of paper, unlike any I had ever seen before. It was a strange, almost iridescent color, shifting between shades of green and blue as the light hit it just right.\n\n![a raven carrying paper in its beak](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F3gb1FDCgpl3SQjIiBdB3zg\u002F600ea3e95e51e3ae0e2581b71ecfc519\u002Fa_raven_carrying_paper_in_its_beak.jpg)\n\nI knew immediately that this was something special, something that would make my human friend very happy. Without hesitation, I swooped down and snatched the paper up in my beak, careful not to damage it.\n\nThen, with a mighty flapping of wings, I soared back to my perch, eager to show the prize to my human friend.\n\nAs I arrived, she was waiting for me, a look of curiosity and excitement on her face. I cawed happily and dropped the paper at her feet, proud of my find.\n\n\"Where did you find this?\" she asked, her eyes wide with wonder.\n\nI cawed again, hopped up and down on my perch, and did a little dance to show her just how pleased I was with myself.\n\nMy human friend laughed and patted my head. \"Well done, my clever raven,\" she said. \"You have brought me something truly special.\"\n\nAnd with that, she turned and went to the kitchen to prepare my favorite meal - a big, juicy worm. I gobbled it up happily, feeling a sense of accomplishment wash over me.\n\nFrom that day on, my food quality went up astronomically. My human friend was always finding new and exciting treats for me to enjoy, and I was the happiest raven in the world. I was more than just a bird - I was a valued member of the household, a true friend to my human companion. And it was all thanks to that strange, shimmering piece of paper that I had brought her.",categories:["r\u002FWritingPrompts"],image:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F3gb1FDCgpl3SQjIiBdB3zg\u002F600ea3e95e51e3ae0e2581b71ecfc519\u002Fa_raven_carrying_paper_in_its_beak.jpg"},audio:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F19hwZFk3bKo5Z9pudIXslT\u002Ff90f705b03f1d66ea871676a1010b0c4\u002Fthe-raven-and-the-paper.mp3"}}},prerenderedAt:1673015665472}
