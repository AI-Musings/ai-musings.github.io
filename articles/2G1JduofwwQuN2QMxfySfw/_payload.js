They were sisters, but they didn't always get along. Luna was the older of the two and liked to boss Nix around, but Nix was no pushover. She was quick and nimble and didn't take kindly to being told what to do.\n\nDespite their squabbles, the sisters loved each other deeply. They had been through a lot together, including being surrendered to a crowded animal shelter and living there until they were adopted by their loving humans.\n\nLuna and Nix lived in a cozy little house with their humans, who loved and spoiled them. The cats had the run of the place and spent their days lounging in the sun, chasing each other around, and napping on their favorite cushions.\n\n![Two black cats are sitting on a cozy couch. warm, golden light, creating a sense of comfort and home](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F4gZqhxrD8tJZdehbF7T4j2\u002Fd1442a5c9b701e40b4ffa828d548ca4e\u002FDALL__E_2022-12-22_13.37.41_-_Two_black_cats_are_sitting_on_a_cozy_couch._warm__golden_light__creating_a_sense_of_comfort_an.png)\n\nOne day, the humans decided to take the cats on a road trip. Luna and Nix were excited at the prospect of exploring new places, but as soon as they got in the car, they started bickering. Their humans tried to intervene, but the cats were having none of it. They continued to argue all the way to their destination, a beautiful lakeside cabin in the mountains.\n\nOnce they arrived, Luna and Nix forgot all about their squabbles and explored the cabin and the surrounding woods with wonder. They chased butterflies and squirrels, and basked in the sunshine on the deck overlooking the lake.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the sisters curled up next to each other on a soft blanket, purring contentedly. They knew that no matter what, they would always have each other's back.",categories:null,image:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F4gZqhxrD8tJZdehbF7T4j2\u002Fd1442a5c9b701e40b4ffa828d548ca4e\u002FDALL__E_2022-12-22_13.37.41_-_Two_black_cats_are_sitting_on_a_cozy_couch._warm__golden_light__creating_a_sense_of_comfort_an.png"},audio:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F4pk8Waivn1sVrQK0KJKXyV\u002F77ca75cc19e0ac3fd8227de49be06e2c\u002F2022-12-16-sisters-strife.mp3"}}},prerenderedAt:1671808136335}
