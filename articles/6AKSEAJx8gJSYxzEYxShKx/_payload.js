Jeremy was an ordinary man, living an ordinary life, until one day he received a letter in the mail. The letter informed him that due to a peculiar event that occurred many generations ago, he was now the rightful owner of a small intergalactic empire.\n\nIt all started with Jeremy's nerdy great great great great grandfather, who in the year 2017 decided to buy a star. At the time, it was a popular trend among people to purchase stars as a form of naming them after themselves or loved ones. Jeremy's ancestor, who was particularly interested in astronomy, decided to name the star after himself.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and it turns out that the star which Jeremy's ancestor named after himself was actually located within the territory of a small intergalactic empire, ruled by a race of intelligent aliens. Due to some legal loopholes, Jeremy's ancestor's purchase was considered legal and binding, and as the current rightful heir, Jeremy inherited the empire.\n\nAt first, Jeremy was skeptical about the whole thing and didn't believe that he could really own an intergalactic empire. But as he delved deeper into the legal paperwork, he realized that it was indeed true. Excitement and curiosity got the better of him, and he decided to take a trip to the empire to see it for himself.\n\nWhen he arrived, he was amazed by the sights and wonders that he saw. He saw planets with diverse landscapes and inhabitants, some of which were more advanced than Earth, while others were still in their primitive state. He met the alien leaders and was surprised to find out that they were friendly and welcoming. They showed him around the empire, and Jeremy quickly learned that he had much to learn from the aliens and their way of life.\n\n![intergalactic empire](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F4Vle7nwf8xfZpNLhM6uVCE\u002F8c07a4b8242a0bad51238d8a6d62413d\u002Fintergalactic_empire.jpg)\n\nAs he spent more time in the empire, he found himself becoming increasingly invested in its well-being and development. He decided to use his newfound power and influence to improve the lives of the empire's inhabitants and to make the empire a more prosperous and peaceful place. And so, he dedicated himself to being the best ruler he could be, guided by fairness, wisdom and compassion.\n\nYears passed and Jeremy was remembered as a great leader, that managed to bring many prosperity to the empire, he was loved and respected by all inhabitants. He had made the impossible, possible and for that, he will always be remembered as the nerdy man that inherited an empire from a star his ancestor had bought one day.\n\nThe end.",categories:["r\u002FWritingPrompts"],image:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F4Vle7nwf8xfZpNLhM6uVCE\u002F8c07a4b8242a0bad51238d8a6d62413d\u002Fintergalactic_empire.jpg"},audio:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F3r46jaGzdc3U5EiqIcjzlB\u002Fc8972c3d76899aee5904491d4a7618f5\u002Fthe-inheritance-of-an-intergalactic-empire.mp3"}}},prerenderedAt:1673587916661}
