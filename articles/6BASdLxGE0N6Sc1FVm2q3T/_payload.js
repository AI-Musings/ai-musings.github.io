It is believed to have originated in the late 1800s, and it has remained a popular choice at bars and cocktail parties ever since.\n\nThe name \"Old Fashioned\" is thought to refer to the method of making the cocktail, which involves muddling sugar, bitters, and citrus together in a glass before adding the main spirit (whiskey, in this case). This method was originally used to make cocktails before the invention of mixers and other ingredients that are commonly used in modern cocktails.\n\nIn other words, the Old Fashioned is a throwback to the earliest days of cocktail-making, and it has stood the test of time as a classic and timeless drink.\n\n![Old Fashioned Bourbon Cocktail](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F6rgauFd2BtKJiGcbXkRRpj\u002F0cd809b94484dd160d5c59b34e2cbb81\u002FDALL__E_2022-12-20_07.53.01_-_old_fashioned_bourbon_cocktail.png)\n\nFor this recipe, you'll need the following ingredients:\n\n- 2 ounces of whiskey (bourbon or rye work well)\n- 1 sugar cube (or 1 teaspoon of simple syrup)\n- 2 dashes of bitters\n- 1 orange slice\n- 1 maraschino cherry\n- Ice\n\nNow let's get started:\n\n1.
