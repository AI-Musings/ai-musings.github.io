Among them was a kind and gentle fairy named Daisy, who spent her days helping the animals and plants in the forest.\n\nOne day, a group of evil trolls invaded the forest, using their magic to terrorize the creatures who lived there. The trolls were determined to destroy the forest and all of its inhabitants, but Daisy was not about to let that happen.\n\nUsing her own magic, Daisy fought bravely against the trolls, but they were too powerful for her to defeat on her own. Just when all hope seemed lost, a group of brave animals came to her aid. Together, they battled the trolls and drove them out of the forest.\n\nThe animals and the fairy celebrated their victory, but they knew that the trolls would not give up easily. They decided to keep watch over the forest, ready to defend it against any future threats.\n\n![A forest in ruin](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F59q7JUUAgBIVBnavo8COEI\u002F909f4c1669de14af449d5b304932d809\u002Fdalle-2022-12-16-112800---the-forest-was-left-in-ruins-the-animals-and-the-fairy-were-nowhere-to-be-found-and-the-once-beaut.png)\n\nBut little did they know, the trolls had not been defeated at all. They had simply retreated to regroup and come back stronger than before. And when they did, they brought with them a dark and powerful magic that no one in the forest had ever seen before.\n\nAs the trolls marched on the forest once again, the animals and the fairy knew that they were no match for the evil magic that the trolls now possessed. But they refused to give up without a fight.\n\nIn the end, the trolls were victorious, and the forest was left in ruins. The animals and the fairy were nowhere to be found, and the once-beautiful forest was now a dark and twisted place, ruled by the evil trolls.\n\nAnd so, the moral of the story is to always be prepared for the unexpected, because sometimes, even the happiest of endings can have a scary twist.",categories:["Children","Scary"],updateAudio:null,audio:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F2eDFMfUjKGjMcVzNQRGesN\u002F9827f08fb2a58ace5c3653bdf651dac9\u002F2022-12-14-forest-lost-magic.mp3"}}},prerenderedAt:1671648500107}
