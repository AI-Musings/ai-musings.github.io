He would stand in front of the bathroom mirror for hours, talking to the boy in the glass. At first, I thought it was just a phase all kids go through. But as time went on, Ethan became more and more withdrawn.\n\nHe would cry at night, saying that the boy in the mirror was evil and wanted to hurt him. I tried to reassure him that it was just his imagination, but he was convinced that something was wrong with the mirror.\n\nI couldn't shake the feeling that there was something off about the mirror too. It seemed to have a dark energy emanating from it. I made the decision to get rid of it, throwing it out in the garbage.\n\nBut that day, as I was tucking Ethan into bed, I noticed something strange. His mole, which had always been on the right side of his face, was now on the left side. I couldn't believe my eyes. I knew in that moment that the mirror had somehow possessed Ethan, using him as a vessel for its evil.\n\nI knew there was no way to save him now. The evil mirror had won, and my son was lost forever.",categories:["r\u002FWritingPrompts"],image:null,audio:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fassets.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F4JSqXPaRWpXCb1sDYA0SLH\u002Fb57d9e46987ccade331698c6d81a2bcc\u002Freflecting-evil.mp3"}}},prerenderedAt:1673242299906}
