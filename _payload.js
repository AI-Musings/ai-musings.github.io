They had been inseparable since childhood, spending countless hours together playing video games, watching movies, and just generally causing mischief.\n\nBut as they grew older, life took them in different directions. Jack ended up moving to the sunny state of California, while Dave found himself in the colder climes of New York. Despite the distance, the two friends remained close, and would often play video games together over the internet.\n\nOne fateful night, Jack and Dave decided to play their favorite horror game, \"The Haunted Mansion\". As they delved deeper into the game, they began to notice strange things happening in their own homes. Doors would slam shut on their own, and eerie whispers could be heard in the darkness.\n\nAt first, they thought it was just their imagination getting the better of them, but as the night wore on, the strange occurrences became more frequent and more frightening. Jack and Dave began to suspect that the game was not just a game, but a portal to a dark and dangerous world.\n\nPanicked, they tried to quit the game, but they found that they were unable to disconnect. As they struggled to break free, the horrors of the game began to spill over into their real lives. Furniture moved on its own, and ghostly apparitions appeared before their eyes.\n\nAs the horrors of the haunted game began to spill over into their real lives, Jack and Dave decided to take a more comical approach to dealing with the ghosts and monsters that were haunting their homes.\n\nThey set up a variety of pranks and traps to catch the ghosts off guard, and would often erupt into fits of laughter as the ghosts fell for their tricks. For example, they would place fake spider webs in doorways, causing the ghosts to scream and jump in surprise. They also set up buckets of water above doors, so that when the ghosts walked through, they would get drenched.\n\n![Buckets of water hanging above doorways](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F6zl5lls8YvPIvpp2gzYSAN\u002F9d9377e28efdbe110fdb1452bbc57cf9\u002Fdalle-2022-12-14-002731---buckets-of-water-above-doorways-with-spiderwebs-that-when-ghosts-walked-through-they-would-get-dre.png)\n\nBut their most effective trick was to set up a speaker system that played the sound of a chainsaw revving. Whenever the ghosts would get too close, Jack and Dave would flip a switch and the sound would blare out, sending the ghosts running in terror.\n\nDespite the terror they were facing, Jack and Dave refused to let the haunted game get the best of them. Instead, they embraced the absurdity of the situation and used their wits and ingenuity to outsmart the ghosts and monsters that were plaguing their homes.\n\nIn the end, Jack and Dave emerged victorious, banishing the evil spirits back to the game world and reclaiming their homes.
