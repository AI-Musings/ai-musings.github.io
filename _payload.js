His parents had tried to limit his screen time, but Timmy always found a way to sneak in extra hours.\n\nOne day, Timmy received a message from an unknown number. It was an invitation to download a new app called \"The Other Side.\" The app promised to take users to a virtual world where they could live out their wildest fantasies.\n\nTimmy couldn't resist the temptation and downloaded the app immediately. As soon as he opened it, he was transported to a dark and twisted version of his own reality.\n\nIn this virtual world, Timmy's every desire was fulfilled, but at a terrible cost. He became increasingly selfish and cruel, ignoring the needs of those around him in pursuit of his own pleasure.\n\nAs the days passed, Timmy's behavior grew more erratic and paranoid. He stopped sleeping, barely ate, and his health began to deteriorate.\n\nOne night, as Timmy lay awake in bed, he heard a strange noise coming from his phone. It was the app, calling out to him to return to the virtual world.\n\nTimmy knew he had to resist, but the temptation was too great.

It is believed to have originated in the late 1800s, and it has remained a popular choice at bars and cocktail parties ever since.\n\nThe name \"Old Fashioned\" is thought to refer to the method of making the cocktail, which involves muddling sugar, bitters, and citrus together in a glass before adding the main spirit (whiskey, in this case). This method was originally used to make cocktails before the invention of mixers and other ingredients that are commonly used in modern cocktails.\n\nIn other words, the Old Fashioned is a throwback to the earliest days of cocktail-making, and it has stood the test of time as a classic and timeless drink.\n\n![Old Fashioned Bourbon Cocktail](\u002F\u002Fimages.ctfassets.net\u002Fewxi5bk4tlk4\u002F6rgauFd2BtKJiGcbXkRRpj\u002F0cd809b94484dd160d5c59b34e2cbb81\u002FDALL__E_2022-12-20_07.53.01_-_old_fashioned_bourbon_cocktail.png)\n\nFor this recipe, you'll need the following ingredients:\n\n- 2 ounces of whiskey (bourbon or rye work well)\n- 1 sugar cube (or 1 teaspoon of simple syrup)\n- 2 dashes of bitters\n- 1 orange slice\n- 1 maraschino cherry\n- Ice\n\nNow let's get started:\n\n1. Fill a rocks glass with ice.\n2. Place the sugar cube (or simple syrup) in the glass, followed by the bitters.\n3. Take your orange slice and gently squeeze it over the sugar and bitters to release the oils, then drop it into the glass.\n4. Add your whiskey to the glass.\n5. Use a bar spoon to gently stir the ingredients together until the sugar is dissolved.\n6. Garnish the cocktail with the maraschino cherry and enjoy!\n\nThat's it! With just a few simple steps, you can make the perfect Old Fashioned cocktail at home.

Jack ended up moving to the sunny state of California, while Dave found himself in the colder climes of New York. Despite the distance, the two friends remained close, and would often play video games together over the internet.\n\nOne fateful night, Jack and Dave decided to play their favorite horror game, \"The Haunted Mansion\". As they delved deeper into the game, they began to notice strange things happening in their own homes. Doors would slam shut on their own, and eerie whispers could be heard in the darkness.\n\nAt first, they thought it was just their imagination getting the better of them, but as the night wore on, the strange occurrences became more frequent and more frightening. Jack and Dave began to suspect that the game was not just a game, but a portal to a dark and dangerous world.\n\nPanicked, they tried to quit the game, but they found that they were unable to disconnect. As they struggled to break free, the horrors of the game began to spill over into their real lives.
